Premium full specular mirrored reflectors are standard for high efficiency lighting: white reflectors may provide up light.

The kit ncludes pre-wired unshunted sockets plus the companion sockets for the other side of the fixture. The kit is UL listed when used either with our lamps provided or LED T8 lamps that UL Classified for Retrofit. This kit will pay for itself in installation and labor savings.</p> <h2>Lamp Specifcations:</h2> <ul> <li>Our T8 LED lamps are available in 2 or 4 ft sizes in different wattage, lumens and color temperature options</li> <li>50,000 Hour Life with 5 Year Warranty</li> <li>Beam Angle 140 Degree</li> <li>Aluminum Base and Aluminum Housing with Glass Cover</li> <li>Operating Temperature: - 20C to 50C</li> <li>Color Temperature: 3500K, 4000K, 5000K</li> <li>G13 Pins (Same as Fluorescent Linear T8 Bipin)</li> <li>AC100 &ndash; 277V without Ballast</li> <li>Single Ended or Double Ended Power (If not specified use X1 Single Ended Power)</li> </ul> <h2>Optional Dimming Options:</h2> <p>The 4 FT lamps are available with a dimming option. Specially designed dimming lamps require an external driver that runs 1 or 2 lamps. So more than 2 lamps require multiple external drivers.</p> <h2>Emergency Options:</h2> <p>The standard X1 LED Lamps require an inverter or an All-in-one emergency kit that includes LED array, battery and driver. Dimmable T8 LED with external driver works with standard LED EM it. See emergency options and specs at www.texasfluorescents.com/ X1LEDemergency.</p></div><div class=""resources_and_downloads""><div class=""block_ResDown""> 			<h2 class=""res_down_title"">RESOURCES AND DOWNLOADS</h2> 			<p class=""resourses""><a href=""/content/resources/specs/RLK-X1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Retrofit 4 T8 Lamps Prewired Unshunted Sockets Kit Specs Sheet</a></p></div></div>",16,0,0,0,13.86,9.7,16.2,0,0,0,,13.86,149,4314,right,0,0,none,0,0,1,0,,1,,,,,RLK4X1WR,,,available,,0,New,,0,0,"Retrofit 4 T8 Lamps Prewired Unshunted Sockets Kit",

<p><strong>CONSTRUCTION<br /></strong>Anodized Aluminum Channel is lightweight, small dimensions and dissipates heat well, designed especially for the flexible LED Tape. Highly tooled plastic end caps screw onto the aluminum channel and protect the channel and LED tape from dust and keep the LED Tape clean and in optimum condition. A raceway in the back of the channel provides both a heat sink for the LED Tape and a holder for screws to pendant mount the channels. The channels can be suspended or flush mounted with optional clips. Snap-in flush frosted lens is specially formulated for smooth illumination of the LED Tape.</p>

After the area is vacated and the time delay has elapsed, the sensors automatically turn the lights off. Ultrasonic detection operates by transmitting sound waves throughout an area and measuring the speed at which they return. Movement increases the return frequency, which triggers occupancy.

This light provides comfortable, glare free lighting with enhanced light output. Available for individual or continuous run design, ITB is popular in mass merchandising, large space applications where lots of light is a must at value pricing. It will provide more light down at the merchandise level. The X1LED recessed strip fixtures utilize efficient LED T8 lamps that provide high lumen output with efficient energy savings. Since they don&rsquo;t require any ballast or driver the only component that will ever need changing is the LED T8 lamp. The lamps are warranted for five years. Unlike recessed strip fixtures that utilize LED arrays and drivers these fixtures have the flexibility to change wattage, lumens, and color temperature simply by changing the lamps without the need to call a licensed electrician.</p> <p><strong>LAMP<br /></strong>2 lamp positions</p> <p><strong>CONSTRUCTION<br /></strong>One-piece housing/reector assembly is die formed from code gauge cold rolled steel. Full end plates, securely riveted into place, close off the trough assuring rigidity and straight rows. Wiring compartments are open end-to-end allowing easy wire-through. Access plates are provided at each end to quickly close off at row ends. A quarter-turn cam fastener, locks closed each embossed 4Ft. ballast cover closing off the wiring compartment.</p> <p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>For recessed mounting in all T-grid ceiling types, 1&rdquo; or 9/16&rdquo; grid sizes. Preferred ceiling to have main tees on one-foot centers with cross tees at 4Ft. or 8Ft. spacing depending on modules used. All units are designed for individual or row mounting; no additional parts needed. Each full end plate has auxiliary suspension points to facilitate supporting to permanent building structures.</p> <p><strong>SIZE W x L x H in inches (mm)<br /></strong>11.71&rdquo; x 95.92&rdquo; x 5.45&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>X1 LED<br /></strong>The most economical, practical and user friendly series of LED fixtures with the energy savings, quality of light, long life and hassle-free maintenance. X1 LED fixtures are UL Listed with the latest LED T8 Bypass lamps. Fixtures provide over 44% energy savings over comparable fluorescent fixtures utilizing less expensive fixtures than the fluorescent version (no ballast required) and have flexibility to change wattage and color temperature any time. Fixture performance will evolve over time with the evolution of the T8 LED lamp technology. Concerned about maintenance with an LED array and driver fixture, X1 LED solves that by utilizing a self contained LED lamp that fits into fixture just like a fluorescent lamp.</p> <p><strong>LAMP SPECIFICATIONS<br /></strong>The 4 FT lamps are available with a dimming option. Specially designed dimming lamps require an external driver that runs 1 or 2 lamps. So more than 2 lamps require multiple external drivers. See dimming options and specs at www.texasfluorescents.com/ X1LEDdimming.</p> <p><strong>EMERGENCY OPTIONS<br /></strong>The standard X1 LED Lamps require an inverter or an All-in-one emergency kit that includes LED array, battery and driver. Dimmable T8 LED with external driver works with standard LED EM it.

X1 LED fixtures are UL Listed with the latest LED T8 Bypass lamps. Fixtures provide over 44% energy savings over comparable fluorescent fixtures utilizing less expensive fixtures than the fluorescent version (no ballast required) and have flexibility to change wattage and color temperature any time. Fixture performance will evolve over time with the evolution of the T8 LED lamp technology. Concerned about maintenance with an LED array and driver fixture, X1 LED solves that by utilizing a self contained LED lamp that fits into fixture just like a fluorescent lamp.&nbsp;</p> <p>A linear 6x6 wall mounted fixture provides distinctive architectural lighting. Ideal for corridors, lobbies and office areas, 6x6 fixtures can be installed individually, continuously or in patterns. The X1LED linear 6 inch linear fixtures utilize efficient LED T8 lamps that provide high lumen output with efficient energy savings. Since they don&rsquo;t require any ballast or driver the only component that will ever need changing is the LED T8 lamp. The lamps are warranted for five years. Unlike linear 6 inch linear fixtures that utilize LED arrays and drivers these fixtures have the flexibility to change wattage, lumens, and color temperature simply by changing the lamps without the need to call a licensed electrician.</p> <p><strong>LAMP<br /></strong>1, or 2 lamp postions</p> <p><strong>CONSTRUCTION<br /></strong>Die-formed and welded 20 gauge cold rolled steel. Knockouts on ends allow continuous wireway mounting. A 1/2&rdquo; regressed flange at the bottom insures uniformity and rigidity. Direct-Indirect fixtures have a 3&rdquo; opening along the length of the fi xture to provide an upward component of between 35%-50% ceiling and wall illumination.</p> <p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>Fixtures can be mounted flush against the wall or hung with wall brackets measuring 4 1/2&rdquo; square by 1&rdquo; deep. Two brackets are used on 2, 3 and 4 foot fixtures and 2 or 3 brackets for 6 and 8 foot fixtures as required.</p> <p><strong>SIZE<br /></strong>6.0&rdquo;H x 96.0&rdquo;L x 6.0&rdquo;H</p> <p><strong>LAMP SPECIFICATIONS</strong></p> <ul> <li>Our T8 LED lamps are available in 2 or 4 ft sizes in different wattage, lumens and color temperature options</li> <li>50,000 Hour Life with 5 Year Warranty</li> <li>Beam Angle 140 Degree</li> <li>Aluminum Base and Aluminum Housing with Glass Cover</li> <li>Operating Temperature: - 20C to 50C</li> <li>Color Temperature: 3500K, 4000K, 5000K</li> <li>G13 Pins (Same as Fluorescent Linear T8 Bipin)</li> <li>AC100 &ndash; 277V without Ballast</li> <li>Single Ended or Double Ended Power (If not specified use X1 Single Ended Power)</li> </ul> <p><strong>OPTIONAL DIMMING OPTIONS<br /></strong>The 4 FT lamps are available with a dimming option. Specially designed dimming lamps require an external driver that runs 1 or 2 lamps. So more than 2 lamps require multiple external drivers.</p> <p><strong>EMERGENCY OPTIONS<br /></strong>The standard X1 LED Lamps require an inverter or an All-in-one emergency kit that includes LED array, battery and driver. Dimmable T8 LED with external driver works with standard LED EM it.
