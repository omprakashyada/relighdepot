</div>
<div class=""ProductDescription"">
<h3><strong>FEATURES &amp; SPECIFICATIONS</strong></h3>
<hr />
<p>Texas fluorescents introduces an eye-catching selection of LED linear lighting channels that can be surface or pendant mounted individually or in a continuous run that put a line of light where you want it with unmatched styling and energy efficiency. Utilizing the latest in LED high powered 24 volt tape lighting sized exactly to the specific channel provides micro-illumination that will not only highlight the area around it beautifully but say ""look here."" Ideal for general lighting applications in both commercial and residential applications for circulation spaces, high impact areas and residentially over tables, kitchen islands and home offices. The versatility and clean styling makes this an ideal choice in many applications. <br /><br />Each linear channel is available in popular sizes, four or eight feet, or can be custom sized for your specific application within some small parameters or can be joined together for longer runs. Each channel requires a remote 24 volt driver sized to the wattage of the channel to power the LED tape. <br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>MATERIALS<br /></strong>Anodized aluminum channel is lightweight, small dimensions, and dissipates heat well, designed especially for the flexible LED tape. Highly tooled plastic end caps screw onto the aluminum channel and protect the channel and LED tape from dust and keep the LED tape clean and in optimum condition. A raceway in the back of the channel provides both a heat sink for the LED tape and a holder for screws to pendant mount the channels. The channels can be suspended or flush mounted. Flush mounting requires fastening the channel to the surface from inside the channel prior to adding the LED Tape. So for surface mounting order channel and LED separately. The channels are factory or field cuttable to any length but exact length should be determined by the application and the exact length of LED Tape that will provide smooth, consistent lighting through out. Joiner splines are available to join channels together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snap in flush frosted lens is specially formulated for smooth illumination of the LED tape. Lens drops down from the channel for an intriguing spill of light out the sides.</p>
<p><strong>ELECTRICAL<br /></strong>High powered and high quality LED tape is exible and designed for high temperature resistant PCB. Tape provides 120 degree illumination in choice of two color temperatures, 3000K or 4000K. The LED tape has a 50,000 average life and is 24V. Tape comes in a 16 foot reel and is designed to be cut every 2 to 4 inches depending on the exact version. Clear 18 gauge electrical wire is soldiered onto the LED tape and comes standard 10 feet. All LED tapes require a 24V remote driver, sold separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WARRANTY<br /></strong>Five year limited warranty.</p>
<p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>Channels can be pendant mounted with a choice of two sizes of cable kits. Each kit comes with 2 cable kits and a canopy. Both kits are fastened to the channel with a screw that floats anywhere along the small channel on the backside of the larger channel. One kit has a small connector for just the cable to be screwed to a surface with screw and molly bolt. The second kit has a connector for both the cable and the electrical cord, and is wired through the canopy. The connector can either be fastened directly to the surface without a junction box or a white canopy and junction box bracket are provided to fasten to a standard 4 inch junction box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each channel requires installation of a remote driver wired to the electrical wiring provided with each channel. Channels can be combined to a single remote driver if total load does not exceed driver wattage rating. <br /><strong><br />DRIVERS(ORDER SEPARATELY)<br /></strong>Choice of constant voltage drivers including: 24 volt magnetic drivers from magnetude which is dimmable with any standard MLV triac dimmer or electronic driver from AC electronic which is dimmable with 0 - 10 volt dimming. See driver specification sheets for details. These class 2 remote power supplies in 24 volt are required and need to be wired to the channels power cord in a junction box. Care should be taken to make sure the driver is mounted within the distance recommended to the Channel itself for best performance. Wire gauge and driver alter the recommended distance. See driver specifications for more detail.</p>

13747,"Line Voltage Wall Switch Sensor - Dual Tech & Photocell, Vacancy Manual On",physical,SW-SWX-133-D,"<p>The <strong>SENSOR</strong>WORX family of wall switch occupancy/vacancy sensors provides a simple yet cost effective lighting control solution for many retrofit applications. Designed with contractors in mind, the <strong>SENSOR</strong>WORX 0-10V dimming wall switch sensor is significantly shallower than typical dimmers and sensors, resulting is less crowed wall boxes. Additionally, versatile wiring enables usage with or without a neutral and allows reversal of line and load connections. <strong>SENSOR</strong>WORX products utilize the latest passive in infrared technology and digital signal processing techniques to provides unmatched motion detection performance. These units are also available with an integrated microphone to provide overlapping passive acoustic occupancy detection for rooms with obstructions or where occupant motion is limited. For dimming adjustment, intuitive raise and lower buttons are present in a additional to an on/off button.</p>

</ul>
<h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>A wall switch sensor is typically used to retrofit an existing wall switch in a small room or enclosed space. A Passive Infrared (PIR) only sensor is sufficient for spaces where line of site is maintained and occupants are periodically moving (e.g., copy rooms, storage rooms). Dual technology sensors are necessary where occupants may be partially blocked from the sensor&rsquo;s direct view or where they may be stationary (e.g., private offices or restrooms with stalls).</p>

13838,"Fixture Mount On/Off Photocell Sensor - Line Voltage",physical,SW-SWX-550,"<p>The SENSORWORX fixture mounted photocell and daylight harvesting sensor is a convenient self-contained control solution. Basic on/off units are capable of directly switching lights off when ambient levels are high enough that desired overall light levels will be still be maintained. Lights will be switched back on once ambient level falls below the desired setpoint.</p>
<p>Units with the daylight harvesting (dimming) option track a space&rsquo;s overall illumination and dim connected lighting to achieve energy savings. During times of high daylight contribution to a space, controlled artificial lighting will be gradually dimmed to a minimum dimmed level. During times of no or low daylight contribution, controlled artificial lighting will increase back up to its maximum level. The sensor can also be configured to switch lighting off completely in maintained high daylight conditions. Additional configurable parameters include high &amp; low trim levels and fade rates.</p>
<p>All photocells provide the option of selecting the ambient light threshold (e.g., setpoint) from a range of preset values or running an auto-selection mode where the unit will determine the setpoint based on the measured amount of light it is controlling.</p>
<h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>There are two types of photocell operation; ON/OFF PHOTOCELL CONTROL and DAYLIGHT HARVESTING CONTROL (see descriptions below).</p>
<p>ON/OFF PHOTOCELL CONTROL</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommended for warehouses, garage bays, storage, etc wherefully switching lighting off/on will not be noticed.</li>
<li>Photocell will switch lights off if ambient light level surpasses threshold and back on if level drops.</li>
<li>To prevent cycling of lights back on after lighting is turned off, a &ldquo;deadband&rdquo; level equal to the measured level of light being controlled is continuously maintained in the unit. For lighting to turn off the ambient light level must be higher than the sum of the setpoint and the deadband.</li>
</ul>
<p>DAYLIGHT HARVESTING CONTROL</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommended for spaces where it is important to not distract occupants.</li>
<li>Unit will gradually dim lighting in order to maximize energy savings while maintaining desired overall lighting level.</li>
<li>After dimming to low trim level, unit can optionally be enabled to turn off lights completely.</li>

13853,"Low Voltage Decorator On/Off Switch",physical,SW-SWX-801,"<p>The SENSORWORX low voltage decorator wall switch provides an attractive companion wall station for a low voltage sensor system. Many spaces now require by code (e.g., ASHRAE 90.1, IECC, Title 24) manual on, partial-on, or full range dimming user operation in addition to an occupancy sensor providing automatic off control. The simplest way of achieving this is by adding a low voltage wall station that interfaces with the power pack controlling the rooms lighting. Adding a switch to a low voltage sensor system also enables users to override a space&rsquo;s lighting off if necessary. Functioning as a momentary switch, this one button wall station is intuitive to use and provides pleasant tactile feedback. Visually, the unit matches the SENSORWORX line of wall switch sensors, ensuring a consistent style across multiple spaces on a project. Additionally, the single button switch has an integrated locator LED with multiple color and intensity settings. Three button dimming units have an integrated 0-10V output, intuitive raise/lower buttons, and a five LED level indicator.</p>
<p>The SENSORWORX low voltage decorator wall station functions as a momentary switch with a pulse length of 250 msec. Typically, it is utilized along with any SENSORWORX power pack with the auxiliary switch input option (e.g. model SWX-900-AX). Using a four-conductor low voltage wire (typically 18 AWG), low voltage power, common, and relay status is wired from the power pack to the switch. The switch output is then wired back to the power pack&rsquo;s auxiliary switch input. For applications requiring Vacancy (e.g., Manual On) operation, the switch signals the power pack to turn on lighting after the unit&rsquo;s button is pressed. To achieve multi-way switching, two or more single button units can be wired in parallel.</p>
<p>For three button units with integrated dimming, an additional 0-10V output wire is provided to connect directly to fixtures. By default, the lights will always come on to the last dim level, however the unit can be programmed to turn-on to a preset level in order to accommodate partial-on applications.</p>
<h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
<p>A wall station can be added to any space where a low voltage control system is used. Energy codes require either Manual On or Partial On to 50% for many spaces such as:</p>

<p>Sensors detect movement in the infrared energy that radiates from occupants as they move within the devices field-of-view. Once occupancy is identified, the sensor signals a connected power/relay pack to switch on the connected lighting. All stand alone units can also be configured to operate in Vacancy Mode (e.g., require lights be manually switched on). Once lights are on and if equipped with passive dual technology (PIR/Acoustic), the unit&rsquo;s microphone is enabled to further enhance detection. An internal timer is set to keep lights on during brief periods of inactivity, and is reset every time occupancy is signaled by either the passive infrared or acoustic detection technologies. Ambient daylight detection can also be enabled in equipped units so that lights are held off in rooms with sufficient light contribution from windows or skylights.

Additionally, they switch on/off power to the connected lighting load as directed by the sensors and controls. SENSORWORX power packs utilize a powerful microprocessor to optimize its switching timing in order to ensure long relay life even when controlling high-inrush LEDs and ballast loads. As with all SENSORWORX products, these power packs are easy to install and incorporate features which reduce contractor labor time. An elongated chase nipple with snaps for quick installation and an optional snap-on low voltage wire chamber make for a hassle free contractor experience. All SENSORWORX products are proudly made in the USA.</p>
<p>An input signal indicating occupancy from one or more connected sensors will signal the pack&rsquo;s<br />integrated relay to close. Once closed, line voltage will flow through the relay and turn on the connected lighting load. When the input signal indicates the occupied period has ended, the relay<br />will open and lighting will switch off. This pack is also available with an auxiliary switch input<br />to enable manual on, hold on, and hold off configurations. Partial off (e.g. auto off to 50%) and<br />partial on (e.g., auto on to 50%) operation can also be achieved using the optional 0-10V stepped dimming output.</p>
