Flangeless version includes a specially designed mud-in flange adjustable to accommodate different sheetrock thicknesses and installation methods. Mud-in flange can be adjusted to 1/8"", 1/2"" or 5/8"" to match sheetrock thicknesses and mud-in methods. The Series CLF is available in 4 or 8 foot sections that can be used individually or joined together for a longer run. A uniquely designed kit that includes a 3 foot, 2 foot and 1 foot channel can be used together to make one six foot channel or used individually for a unique look with three cascading sizes of 1, 2 and 3 foot channels. The 3, 4 and 8 foot channels have integral drivers and the 3 foot has a unique plug and play wiring system with its integral driver to power the 1ft and 2ft channels with a 6 ft cord (consult for longer cords). Series CLF is scaled for commercial applications especially in corridors, elevator vestibules. conference rooms and retail applications as well as residential applications. The linear channels have a frosted lens and provide 750 lumens per foot in 3000K or 4000K options.

12180,"8 Foot 2.36"" Diameter Round Body LED Linear Lighting Channel",physical,TF-LLLRB99L96W4976L,"<div class=""short-description""> <p>2.36"" diameter round body LED linear lighting channel, RB extrusion with lens and 2 end caps and tape installed with 10' clear wire, 8 foot, 96 watts, 4976 lumens, available in 3000K and 4000K color temperature (CCT), 5 year limited warranty.</p> </div> <div class=""ProductDescription""> <h2><strong>FEATURES &amp; SPECIFICATIONS</strong></h2> <hr /> <p>Texas fluorescents introduces an eye-catching selection of LED linear lighting channels that can be surface or pendant mounted individually or in a continuous run that put a line of light where you want it with unmatched styling and energy effciency. Utilizing the latest in LED high powered 24 volt tape lighting sized exactly to the specific channel provides micro-illumination that will not only highlight the area around it beautifully but say ""look here."" Ideal for general lighting applications in both commercial and residential applications for circulation spaces, high impact areas and residentially over tables, kitchen islands and home offices. The versatility and clean styling makes this an ideal choice in many applications. <br /><br />Each linear channel is available in popular sizes, four or eight feet, or can be custom sized for your specific application within some small parameters or can be joined together for longer runs. Each channel requires a remote 24 volt driver sized to the wattage of the channel to power the LED tape. <br /><br />This round channel utilizes a snap in drop down lens to provide 527 lumens per foot using less than 8.78 watts.</p> <p><strong>MATERIALS<br /></strong>Anodized aluminum channel is lightweight, small dimensions, and dissipates heat well, designed especially for the flexible LED tape. Highly tooled plastic end caps screw onto the aluminum channel and protect the channel and LED tape from dust and keep the LED tape clean and in optimum condition. A raceway in the back of the channel provides both a heat sink for the LED tape and a holder for screws to pendant mount the channels. The channels can be suspended or flush mounted. Flush mounting requires fastening the channel to the surface from inside the channel prior to adding the LED Tape. So for surface mounting order channel and LED separately. The channels are factory or field cuttable to any length but exact length should be determined by the application and the exact length of LED Tape that will provide smooth, consistent lighting throughout. Joiner splines are available to join channels together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Snap in flush frosted lens is specially formulated for smooth illumination of the LED tape.</p> <p><strong>ELECTRICAL<br /></strong>High powered and high quality LED tape is exible and designed for high temperature resistant PCB. Tape provides 120 degree illumination in choice of two color temperatures, 3000K or 4000K. The LED tape has a 50,000 average life and is 24V. Tape comes in a 16 foot reel and is designed to be cut every 2 to 4 inches depending on the exact version. Clear 18 gauge electrical wire is soldiered onto the LED tape and comes standard 10 feet. All LED tapes require a 24V remote driver, sold separately.</p> <p><strong>WARRANTY<br /></strong>Five year limited warranty.</p> <p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>Channels can be pendant mounted with a choice of two sizes of cable kits. Each kit comes with 2 cable kits and a canopy. Both kits are fastened to the channel with a screw that oats anywhere along the small channel on the backside of the larger channel. One kit has a small connector for just the cable to be screwed to a surface with screw and molly bolt. The second kit has a connector for both the cable and the electrical cord, and is wired through the canopy. The connector can either be fastened directly to the surface without a junction box or a white canopy and junction box bracket are provided to fasten to a standard 4 inch junction box.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each channel requires installation of a remote driver wired to the electrical wiring provided with each channel. Channels can be combined to a single remote driver if total load does not exceed driver wattage rating.</p> <p><strong>DRIVERS (ORDER SEPARATELY)<br /></strong>Choice of constant voltage drivers including: 24 volt magnetic drivers from Magnetude which is dimmable with any standard MLV triac dimmer or electronic driver from AC electronic which is dimmable with 0 - 10 volt dimming. See driver specification sheets for details. These class 2 remote power supplies in 24 volt are required and need to be wired to the channels power cord in a junction box. Care should be taken to make sure the driver is mounted within the distance recommended to the Channel itself for best performance. Wire gauge and driver alter the recommended distance. See driver specifications for more detail.</p> </div> <div class=""resources_and_downloads""> <div class=""block_ResDown""> <h2 class=""res_down_title"">RESOURCES AND DOWNLOADS</h2> <p class=""resourses""><a href=""../../../../content/resources/specs/LLLRBseries.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Round Body LED Linear Lighting Channel Spec Sheet</a></p> </div> </div>",32,0,0,0,470,0,0,0,0,0,,470,149,6305,right,10,0,none,0,0,1,0,,1,,,,,LLLRB99L96W4976L,,,available,,0,New,,0,0,"2.36"" Diameter Round Body LED Linear Lighting Channel, 42W or 96W",
