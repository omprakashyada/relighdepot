Utilizing the latest in LED high powered 24 volt tape lighting sized exactly to the specific channel provides micro-illumination that will not only highlight the area around it beautifully but say ""look here."" Ideal for general lighting applications in both commercial and residential applications for circulation spaces, high impact areas and residentially over tables, kitchen islands and home offices. The versatility and clean styling makes this an ideal choice in many applications. <br /><br />Each linear channel is available in popular sizes, four or eight feet, or can be custom sized for your specific application within some small parameters or can be joined together for longer runs. Each channel requires a remote 24 volt driver sized to the wattage of the channel to power the LED tape. <br /><br />This round channel utilizes a snap in drop down lens to provide 527 lumens per foot using less than 8.78 watts.</p> <p><strong>MATERIALS<br /></strong>Anodized aluminum channel is lightweight, small dimensions, and dissipates heat well, designed especially for the flexible LED tape. Highly tooled plastic end caps screw onto the aluminum channel and protect the channel and LED tape from dust and keep the LED tape clean and in optimum condition. A raceway in the back of the channel provides both a heat sink for the LED tape and a holder for screws to pendant mount the channels. The channels can be suspended or flush mounted. Flush mounting requires fastening the channel to the surface from inside the channel prior to adding the LED Tape. So for surface mounting order channel and LED separately. The channels are factory or field cuttable to any length but exact length should be determined by the application and the exact length of LED Tape that will provide smooth, consistent lighting throughout. Joiner splines are available to join channels together.&nbsp;</p> <p>Snap in flush frosted lens is specially formulated for smooth illumination of the LED tape.</p> <p><strong>ELECTRICAL<br /></strong>High powered and high quality LED tape is exible and designed for high temperature resistant PCB. Tape provides 120 degree illumination in choice of two color temperatures, 3000K or 4000K. The LED tape has a 50,000 average life and is 24V. Tape comes in a 16 foot reel and is designed to be cut every 2 to 4 inches depending on the exact version. Clear 18 gauge electrical wire is soldiered onto the LED tape and comes standard 10 feet. All LED tapes require a 24V remote driver, sold separately.</p> <p><strong>WARRANTY<br /></strong>Five year limited warranty.</p> <p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>Channels can be pendant mounted with a choice of two sizes of cable kits. Each kit comes with 2 cable kits and a canopy. Both kits are fastened to the channel with a screw that oats anywhere along the small channel on the backside of the larger channel. One kit has a small connector for just the cable to be screwed to a surface with screw and molly bolt. The second kit has a connector for both the cable and the electrical cord, and is wired through the canopy. The connector can either be fastened directly to the surface without a junction box or a white canopy and junction box bracket are provided to fasten to a standard 4 inch junction box.&nbsp;</p> <p>Each channel requires installation of a remote driver wired to the electrical wiring provided with each channel. Channels can be combined to a single remote driver if total load does not exceed driver wattage rating.</p> <p><strong>DRIVERS (ORDER SEPARATELY)<br /></strong>Choice of constant voltage drivers including: 24 volt magnetic drivers from Magnetude which is dimmable with any standard MLV triac dimmer or electronic driver from AC electronic which is dimmable with 0 - 10 volt dimming. See driver specification sheets for details. These class 2 remote power supplies in 24 volt are required and need to be wired to the channels power cord in a junction box. Care should be taken to make sure the driver is mounted within the distance recommended to the Channel itself for best performance. Wire gauge and driver alter the recommended distance.

Utilizing the latest in LED High Powered 24 Volt tape lighting sized exactly to the specific channel provides micro illumination that will not only highlight the area around it beautifully, but say &ldquo;look here&rdquo;. Ideal for general lighting applications in both commercial and residential applications for circulation spaces, high impact areas and residentially over tables, kitchen islands and home offices. The versatility and clean styling makes this an ideal choice in many applications.<br /><br />Each linear channel is available in popular sizes, 4 or 8 feet, or can be custom sized for your specific application within some small parameters or can be joined together for longer runs. Each channel requires a remote 24 volt driver sized to the wattage of the channel to power the LED tape. This square channel utilizes a snap in drop down lens to provide 375 lumens per foot at less than 6 watts.</p> <p><strong>MATERIALS<br /></strong>Anodized aluminum channel is lightweight, small dimensions and dissipates heat well, designed especially for the LED tape. Highly tooled plastic end caps screw onto the aluminum channel and protect the channel the LED tape from dust and keep the LED tape clean and in optimum condition. A raceway in the back of the channel provides both a heat sink for the LED tape and a holder for screws to pendant mount the channels. The channels can be suspended or flush mounted. Flush mounting requires fastening the channel to the surface from inside the channel prior to adding the LED tape. For surface mounting, order channel and LED separately. The channels are factory or field cuttable to any length but exact length should be determined by the application and the exact length of LED tape that will provide smooth, consistent lighting throughout. Joiner splines are available to join channels together. Snap in flush frosted lens is specially formulated for smooth illumination of the LED tape.</p> <p><strong>ELECTRICAL<br /></strong>High powered and high quality LED tape is flexible and designed for high temperature resistanty PCB. Tape provides 120&deg; illumination in choice of two color temperatures, 3000k or 4000k. The LED tape has a 50,000 average life and is 24V. Tape comes in a 8 foot reel and is designed to be cut every 2 to 4 inches depending on the exact version. Clear 18 gauge electrical wire is soldered onto the LED tape and comes standard 10 feet. All LED tapes require a 24V remote driver, sold separately</p> <p><strong>MOUNTING<br /></strong>Channels can be recessed mounted only. Recessed mounting requires specifying the channel and LED tape separately so that the channel can be mounted first with mounting clips. The LED tape will need to be ordered separately and then field installed. Each channel requires installation of a remote driver wired to the electrical wiring provided with each channel. Channels can be combined to a single remote driver if total load does not exceed driver wattage rating.</p> <p><strong>DRIVERS (ORDERED SEPARATELY)<br /></strong>Choice of constant voltage drivers including: 24V magnetic drivers from Magnitude which is dimmable with any standard MLV Triac dimmer or electronic driver from AC Electronic which is dimmable with 0-10V dimming. See Driver Specification sheets for details. These Class 2 remote power supplies in 24V are required and need to be wired to the channel&rsquo;s power cord in a junction box. Care should be taken to make sure the driver is mounted within the distance recommended to the channel itself for best performance. Wire gauge and driver alter the recommended distance.
